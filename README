Modification of the Trent Richardson's jQuery-UI Timepicker widget addon for 
the native jQuery-UI datepicker.

Making some slight amendments, mostly running it through jslint to clean it 
up and make it more friendly to minification as well as fixing some issues
I had with it not recognising certain timeformats.
